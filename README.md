# Fullstack Project Management System
Hi, Welcome to my Fullstack Project Management Systme, I made this project using React/Typescript for the Front-end part and .Net Core for the Back-end part

## Funcionality
* When a user is Logged can do:
    * Create a Project(CRUD)
    * Assign new Users into the project
    * Create List for that Project and Task for that List(CRUD)
    * Inside a Task you can Edit, change the priority, add description, assign User to that task and add Subtask

## Next Features
* Loggin with 3rd parts (google, github)
* Add Comments into a task
* Improve the Design and UX
* Dark Mode
